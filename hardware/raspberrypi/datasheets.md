## Datasheets

### SoC's

The following datasheets are available for the SoC (System On Chip - the main processing chip) devices used on the Raspberry Pi platform.

[BCM2711](bcm2711/rpi_DATA_2711_1p0.pdf) - The SoC used on the Raspberry Pi 4.

[BCM2835](bcm2735/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf) - The SoC used on the Raspberry Pi 0 and 1. This datasheet is also applicable to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, with the BCM2836 and BC2837 SoC's respectively, as the Videocore GPU is the same.
